## Won the first prize in the Competition of OurCS@DFW Undergraduate Women in Computing.

# Project Objectives
“Air Quality Index, today, in the Dallas/Fort-Worth Region is 52; There may be a moderate health concern for a very small number of people. People with respiratory problems should exercise caution.” -- How to get this information by your own developed IoT systems?

In this project, we design and build an IoT based Air Quality Monitoring System with ESP8266 Microcontroller (MCU) and Arduino. Also, we aggregate and analyze live data streams with the ThingSpeak cloud computing system. Visualize PM2.5 air quality of campus in heat maps.
